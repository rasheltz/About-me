# About-me
Hey! :)
I deleted my first post, so here is my introduction again:
- My name is Rashel
- I am an environmental sciences student
- Currently working on a GIS (geographic information system) project for a future publication (thesis/article)
- You can contact me via email at 422003003@enesmerida.unam.mx

Would love to find useful tips for R and GIS softwares.
I am new to coding and statistics so please be patient and kind!
